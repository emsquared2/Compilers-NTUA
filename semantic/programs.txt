Array related:  23
Adjust:         6, 15

Notes:

1) If a function has returned then we shouldn't keep doing semantic analysis, gen code etc. - what ?
2) ConstStr->sem(): type should be Array and not IArray
3) Ensure that a non void function will include return statement.

# Updated 4/05/2024
13, 14) sem error appears as type mismatch - maybe improve message clarity? (13 - return, 14 - fparams)
15, 16, 17, 21) Probably error not attributed to a SemanticError 
23) add check of 0 sized array


Assign,  Block, CallStmt(?), Return, If
3 applies to funcdef
